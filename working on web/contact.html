        <h3>The distillation techniquesare mostly used in the industry for proper separation of raw crude oil. Distillation is a proces of separation by vapourisation, a liquid mixture miscible and volatie substances into individual components or group of components eg, crude petroleum.</h3>
            <h3><u><dt> Gas Absorption;</u></dt>
            <dt> Here a soluble vapour is absorbed by means of a liquid soluent eg, gas ddehydration.</dt>
            <dt> <u> Gas Adsorption;</u></dt> 
            <dt> In this process, a solute is removed from either a liquid or gas through contact with a solid absorbent eg; ngos dehydration using solid absorbents that can be regenrated or reactivated eg; silica gel and silica alumina bits.</dt>
            <dt><u> Desorption or stripping;</u></dt>
            <dt> when a solid is transfered from the soluent to the gas phase, the operation is known as stripping. it is when volatile compoent is transfered into a gas.</dt> </h3>
