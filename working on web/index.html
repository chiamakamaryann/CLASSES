                <h1><dt>DISTILLATION</dt></h1>
                <dd>it is a thermal separation method in which crude oil is separated into its fraction according to the wide range of vapour pressuresof its constituents.</dd>
            <h2> There are two types of Distillation </h2>
            <ul><li>Atmosphericdistillaation</li>
            <li>Vacuum distillation</li></ul>

        <dd>in atmospheric distillation, the feedstock is heated at the pipe funace in the temperature of about 320-330<sup>o</sup>C from where the oil vapour is fed into the fraction column for separation into fractions. the column is cylindrical about 40m high and 1-1.65m diameter. in the fractionating column, the oil vapour introduced at lower part of the column flows through the entire lane of the column. the oil vapour passes through the tray in contact with the liquid flowing in opposite direction. hence there exist intensive mass and heat transfer between the two phases. a <b>tray</b> is a horizontal circular plate on which the condense liquid can outlet. as the energy is transfered to the liquid fowing downwards by the oil vapour below boiling component of the liquid is evaporated while the high boiling component of the vapour phase is condensed. these process continues until there exist an equilibrium or established at which various farctions are collected at the trays thereby having low boiling fractions upwards and high boiling fractions downwards. the light gaseous component is collect from the top of the column. the fractionating column terminate withh the sump where the atmospheric residue is collected, however any further heating of the sump product about 400<sup>o</sup>C could result to undesirable thermal reactions. hence distillation is carried out under vacuum.</dd>

    <dt><b>Vacuum distillation</b></dt>
    <dd>in vacuum distillation, the feedstock from atmospheric distillation is heated at the pipe funace and the same processes are carried out as in atmospheric distillation at reduced pressure using the water jet point (to maintain a vacuum).</dd>
    <dd>in vaccum distillation unit, fractions like lubricating oil or asphalt and the vacuum gas oil (VGO) are produced as main fractions while vacuum residue is used for fuel oil blending.</dd>
